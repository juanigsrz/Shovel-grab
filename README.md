# Shovel-grab
Shovel-grab is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for generating personalized resumes.

## Introduction

Shovel-grab parsing and evaluation process is done in Haskell. It mainly uses the [Megaparsec](https://github.com/mrkkrp/megaparsec) library to parse the language,
and so to build the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Shovel-grab outputs your resume in HTML, which can be easily converted to PDF.
It uses [latex.css](https://github.com/davidrzs/latexcss) by default, though it can be customized.

## Setup

After cloning the project you should start off by installing Megaparsec:

``` stack install megaparsec ```

If you are not using Stack, simply replace ``` stack ``` with ``` cabal ```.
