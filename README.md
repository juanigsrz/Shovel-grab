# Shovel-grab
Shovel-grab is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for generating personalized resumes.


## Introduction
Shovel-grab is built in Haskell using Stack. It uses the [Megaparsec](https://github.com/mrkkrp/megaparsec) library to parse the language.

Shovel-grab outputs your resume in HTML, which can be easily converted to PDF.
It uses [latex.css](https://github.com/davidrzs/latexcss) by default, though it can be customized.


## Setup
As a regular Stack project, all the project dependencies are already in ``` package.yaml ```, so simply clone the project and run:

``` stack build ```

That should start you off by installing all the required dependencies and building the project.
